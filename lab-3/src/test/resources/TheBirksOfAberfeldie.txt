Lovely girl, will you go, 
Will you go, will you go? 
Lovely girl, will you go, 
To the birches of Aberfeldie? 

Now summer shines on flowery hill sides, 
And over the crystal streamlets plays, 
Come, let us spend the lightsome days 
In the birches of Aberfeldie! 

The little birdies blythely sing, 
While over their heads the hazels hang, 
Or lightly flit on wanton wing 
In the birches of Aberfeldie! 

The hill sides ascend like lofty walls, 
The foaming stream, deep-roaring, falls 
Over hung with fragrant-spreading woods, 
The birches of Aberfeldie. 

The hoary cliffs are crowned with flowers, 
White over the falls the streamlet pours, 
And, rising, wets with misty showers 
The birches of Aberfeldie. 

Let Fortune's gifts at random flee, 
They never shall draw a wish from me, 
Supremely blest with love and you 
In the birches of Aberfeldie.
